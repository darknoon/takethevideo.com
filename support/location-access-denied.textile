h1. Error: Location access denied

h2. What causes this error?

Most likely, you declined to give Take access to your location when starting for the first time.

A setting on your phone has prevented Take from being able to save videos. To prevent your shooting a video and not being able to save it (losing the video), Take won't shoot videos until the setting is corrected.

On iOS 5, access to Photos is controlled by Location Services because photos and videos may contain information about the location in which they were taken.

On iOS 6, location information is now segregated from access to the videos themselves, so if you do not want to allow Take to access your location, I recommend you upgrade to iOS 6.0 or later.


h2. How to fix it

* Open the Settings app from your home screen
* Navigate to Location
* Flip switch next to Take to On

h2. How to upgrade to iOS 6.0 or later
* Connect your device to a computer with iTunes installed
* Follow the directions on screen to back up and update your device

Alternately, you can bring your device to an Apple Store for an upgrade.
