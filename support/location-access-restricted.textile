h1. Error: Location access restricted

h2. What causes this error?

A setting on your phone has prevented Take from being able to save videos. To prevent your shooting a video and not being able to save it (losing the video), Take won't shoot videos until the setting is corrected.

This restriction may have been put in place by an administrator or parent on your iOS device. In this case you should contact this person for assistance.

On iOS 5, access to Photos is controlled by Location Services because photos and videos may contain information about the location in which they were taken.

On iOS 6, location information is now segregated from access to the videos themselves, so if you do not want to allow location services on your device, I recommend you upgrade to iOS 6.0 or later.


h2. How to fix it

* Open the settings app from your home screen
* Navigate to General
* Tap on Restrictions
* Flip the Photos switch to Off

h2. How to upgrade to iOS 6.0 or later
* Connect your device to a computer with iTunes installed
* Follow the directions on screen to back up and update your device

Alternately, you can bring your device to an Apple Store for an upgrade.
