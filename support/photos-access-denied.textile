h1. Error: Photos access denied

h2. What causes this error?

Most likely, you declined to give Take access to your photos when starting for the first time.

A setting on your phone has prevented Take from being able to save videos. To prevent your shooting a video and not being able to save it (losing the video), Take won't shoot videos until the setting is corrected.

h2. How to fix it

* Open the settings app from your home screen
* Navigate to Privacy
* Tap on Photos
* Flip the Take switch to On
