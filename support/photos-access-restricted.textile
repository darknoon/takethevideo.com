h1. Error: Photos access restricted

h2. What causes this error?

A setting on your phone has prevented Take from being able to save videos. To prevent shooting a video and not being able to save it (losing the video), Take won't shoot videos until the setting is corrected.

This restriction may have been put in place by an administrator or parent on your iOS device. In this case you should contact this person for assistance.

h2. How to fix it

* Open the settings app from your home screen
* Navigate to General
* Tap on Restrictions
* Flip the Photos switch to Off
